  - [ ] Test snapshotting against remote PostgreSQL

## Phase 5: API Endpoints for Monitoring Data
- [ ] Activity/time series endpoints
  - [ ] Endpoint for activity over time (for charts)
- [ ] Session details endpoint
- [ ] Statement stats endpoint (top queries, slow queries)
- [ ] Object metadata/size endpoint
- [ ] Lock/blocking info endpoint

  - [ ] Time series chart of session activity
  - [ ] Wait events per session
  - [ ] Statement execution times
- [ ] Object Browser
  - [ ] Tree/table view of all database objects
  - [ ] Search/filter functionality
- [ ] Locks & Blockings Page
  - [ ] Table of current locks and blocking sessions
