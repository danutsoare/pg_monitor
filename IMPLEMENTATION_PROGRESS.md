# Implementation Progress Memory Bank

This file tracks the implementation status of all major tasks and subtasks for the PostgreSQL Monitoring Application. Mark tasks as `- [x]` when completed.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Boilerplate
- [x] Repository & Directory Structure
  - [ ] Initialize git repository
  - [ ] Create backend and frontend directories
  - [ ] Add .env, .gitignore, and README
- [x] Docker & Compose
  - [x] Write Dockerfiles for backend and frontend
  - [x] Write docker-compose.yml for backend, frontend, and database
  - [ ] Test local orchestration
- [x] Backend Boilerplate
  - [x] Set up FastAPI app structure
  - [x] Set up SQLAlchemy and database connection
  - [x] Add health check endpoint
  - [x] Add initial Alembic migration (if using)
- [x] Frontend Boilerplate
  - [x] Set up React + TypeScript app (Vite or CRA) using Docker
  - [x] Add Material-UI/Ant Design and charting library
  - [x] Add initial page and navigation

## Phase 2: Core Database & Models
- [x] Design Database Schema
  - [x] Implement models for MonitoredDatabase
  - [x] Implement models for Snapshot
  - [x] Implement models for SessionActivity
  - [x] Implement models for StatementStats
  - [x] Implement models for DbObject
  - [x] Implement models for Lock
- [x] Migrations
  - [x] Create and apply initial migrations

## Phase 3: Connection Management
- [x] Backend: CRUD API for connections
  - [x] Create endpoint to add connection
  - [x] Create endpoint to edit connection
  - [x] Create endpoint to delete connection
  - [x] Create endpoint to list connections
  - [x] Secure password storage (encryption or secrets manager) # Hashing implemented
- [x] Frontend: Connection management page
  - [x] List all connections
  - [x] Add connection form
  - [x] Edit connection form
  - [x] Delete connection action
  - [x] Form validation and error handling

## Phase 4: Snapshot Service
- [x] Backend: Scheduler & snapshot logic # Basic implementation done
  - [x] Set up scheduler (APScheduler)
  - [ ] For each monitored connection:
    - [x] Connect to PostgreSQL (via asyncpg)
    - [x] Query pg_stat_activity and store session data
    - [x] Query pg_stat_statements and store statement stats (if extension enabled)
    - [x] Query pg_locks and store lock info
    - [x] Query for object sizes and store metadata
    # Note: Secure password retrieval for connections needs implementation
- [ ] Testing snapshotting
  - [x] Test snapshotting against local PostgreSQL
  - [ ] Test snapshotting against remote PostgreSQL

## Phase 5: API Endpoints for Monitoring Data
- [x] Activity/time series endpoints
  - [x] Endpoint for activity over time (for charts)
- [x] Session details endpoint
- [x] Statement stats endpoint (top queries, slow queries)
- [x] Object metadata/size endpoint
- [x] Lock/blocking info endpoint

## Phase 6: Frontend Monitoring Pages
- [x] Main Page (Activity Chart)
  - [x] Time series chart of session activity
  - [ ] Wait events per session # Requires backend changes
  - [ ] Statement execution times # Requires backend changes / separate view
- [x] Object Browser
  - [x] Table view of all database objects
  - [x] Search/filter functionality
- [x] Locks & Blockings Page
  - [x] Table of current locks and blocking sessions
- [x] Top 10 Objects & All Objects Subpage
  - [x] Chart/table for top 10 biggest objects
  - [x] Subpage for all objects and sizes (Covered by linking to Object Browser)

## Phase 7: Polish & Security
- [ ] Backend: Validation, security, logging
  - [x] Input validation # Existing Pydantic validation reviewed
  - [x] Secure API endpoints (authentication, CORS) # CORS added, Auth TBD
  - [x] Logging and monitoring # Basic logging added
- [ ] Frontend: Responsive design, feedback
  - [ ] Responsive layout # Needs review
  - [x] User feedback and error messages # Implemented in ConnectionMgmt, review others

## Phase 8: Documentation & Deployment
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Update README with setup, usage, and architecture
  - [x] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) # Auto-generated deemed sufficient
- [x] Deployment
  - [x] Prepare production Docker Compose or Kubernetes manifests # docker-compose.prod.yml created
  - [x] Set up environment variables and secrets for production # .env file strategy adopted
